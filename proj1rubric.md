|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|in GH|
| Number of commits: by different people|in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**| 3 | Total issues opened 41 https://github.com/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/issues?q=|
| issues are being  closed| 3| Total issues closed 33 https://github.com/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed
| DOI badge: exists | 3 | https://zenodo.org/record/5528349#.YVGy_kbMIeY
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | For each method, there is a description of the method. There are then descriptions of parameters, types, and return types. [Ex](https://mtkumar123.github.io/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/code.html#module-code.extract_sizes)|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
| Use of version control tools| 3| Use of git and github. Use of branches, and commits. https://github.com/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid
|Use of  style checkers | 3 |Used Pylint, and ran Pylint Warning and Error checks as part of Travis CI| 
| Use of code  formatters. | 3 | Used Pylint, and ran Pylint Warning and Error checks as part of Travis CI|
| Use of syntax checkers. |  3 | Used Pylint, and ran Pylint Warning and Error checks as part of Travis CI  |
| Use of code coverage | 3| Coverage at 62%. Used coverage library, and then ran coverage check in Travis to update Coverage badge using Codecov. https://app.codecov.io/gh/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid|
| other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base| Code coverage can be seen [here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/). We have over 18 test cases, covering atleast 55% of the code base. |
| test cases are routinely executed|e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something| Executed every push to origin and merge to main with travis |
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
| issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here| Issues are okayed either on github [example](https://github.com/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/pull/39) [example2](https://github.com/mtkumar123/CSC510_Project_LectureAid/pull/38) or over discord, with majority vote.|
| Chat channel: exists|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
